## üìù Overview

This repository contains several Jupyter notebooks aimed at demonstrating the capabilities of the TensorQuant library in the context of financial modeling and simulations. Each notebook focuses on a different aspect of quantitative finance, ranging from pricing derivatives to performing stochastic analysis.

## üìÇ Notebooks

### Pricing of Derivatives

This section includes notebooks that show how to price various financial derivatives using the TensorQuant library, including:

- **Options pricing**
- **Futures pricing**
- **Swaps and other exotic derivatives**

### Stochastic Analysis

This section provides notebooks focused on stochastic processes and their applications in finance, such as:

- **Monte Carlo simulations**
- **Stochastic differential equations (SDEs)**
- **Risk modeling with stochastic processes**

### Numerical Simulations

In these notebooks, you will find numerical methods used in financial modeling, including:

- **Finite difference methods**
- **Simulation-based techniques for risk management**
- **Convergence analysis for financial models**
